The following animations summarize the molecular dynamics simulations run with the Jones potential and Verlet integration.  For illustrative aid, the periodic domain has been tiled around the blue square.  That is, all position, velocity, energy, and pressure calculations are done within the blue domain, and the rest of the circles are added for visual effect.

Some simulations are run backwards and are indicated by color (red).

Note that pressure and potential energy start very high, and then drop and convert to kinetic energy (and thus heat) when the structure breaks down.

Note that with no perturbations, the steady state persists, but breaks down after about 900 time steps (integrator set to dt = .01) likely due to numerical precision error.

The instability of this orbit is highlighted by a small perterbation in a randomly selected particle. Note that the particles naturally seek a triangular lattice state.

The boundary here is 8.8 and making it a little tight.  This adds osciliation to the system, and illustrates the stability of this configuration.

In both of the crunching simulations, we note that total energy and pressure increase as expected.  A "phase transition" is observed at about time step 400 (dt = .01).  I am not sure if this is an artefact of the integrator or that they really are moving as rapidly as indicated.
